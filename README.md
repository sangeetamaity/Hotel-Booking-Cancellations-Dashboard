## Final Conclusion
### Areas for Improvement:
- Investigate the causes of the high cancellation rate. Potential factors could be pricing, booking policies, competitor offerings, or external events. Implement strategies to mitigate these factors and reduce cancellations.
- Explore ways to increase customer loyalty, especially among transient guests. This could involve loyalty programs, personalized offers, or enhanced guest experiences.
- Ensure efficient room allocation processes to minimize the number of guests receiving different rooms than requested. This could involve improved booking systems, staff training, or better communication with guests.
